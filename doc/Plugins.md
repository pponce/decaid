# Decaid Plugin Development Guide

## BLE Scale Sample Time

The opt-in reference at `examples/plugins/bookoo-mini.reaplugin` implements the
native Bookoo packet/command contract in JS using this path. It is not bundled.
Its README separates deterministic API/protocol tests from required hardware
acceptance and documents the provisional protocol-silence deadline.

BLE notification callbacks receive `(base64Data, sample)`. The optional opaque
`sample` token identifies a host-timestamped notification. After decoding, use
`await session.publish({weight: grams}, sample)` to retain its ingress time even
when JavaScript dispatch/publication is delayed. No timestamp supplied by JS is
trusted. Existing one-argument callbacks/publications remain compatible.

Tokens are binding/session-owned, single-use, ordered, and expire after two
seconds (the existing shot freshness window). At most 256 tokens are retained;
the oldest token is discarded when that bound is reached, without dropping the
notification itself. A foreign, duplicate, out-of-order, evicted, or expired token
returns `stale_sample`. That rejection remains visible to plugin code, but if it
escapes a notification callback the host drops that sample and continues the
subscription. Other callback failures remain fatal. Retirement invalidates all
tokens. A backward clock change retires the BLE session rather than leaving
publication blocked behind its previous timestamp. Reconnect establishes a fresh
timestamp sequence and follows normal Scale recovery policy.

Omitting the token retains publication-ingress time for non-BLE or synthetic
measurements. Do not use that fallback to disguise delayed notification samples.
Accurate sample timestamps do not reduce delivery latency or recover stop commands
missed while JavaScript was stalled.

Plugin Scale commands report stable error codes through the existing Scale REST
routes, including `unsupported_operation` for undeclared tare or timer support.
Automatic shot timer failures are logged without aborting the shot. A Scale with
`disconnectToSleep` uses host deliberate-sleep policy: display-off disconnects it
without recovery until the machine wakes. No plugin reconnect loop is needed.

## Overview

> **Note on naming:** Plugin JS APIs use `Rea`-prefixed names (`fetchReaSettings`, `updateReaSetting`, `convertReaToVisualizerFormat`) for backwards compatibility with existing plugins. These were not renamed during the app rename from ReaPrime to Decaid.

Decaid plugins are JavaScript modules that extend the functionality of Decaid.
Plugins run in a sandboxed JavaScript environment and can react to machine events,
store data, make HTTP requests, and emit events through the Decaid API.

## Plugin Structure

A Decaid plugin consists of two required files:

### 1. `manifest.json` - Plugin metadata and configuration

> **`id` restrictions:** The plugin id becomes a directory name under the app's `plugins/` folder, so it must be a single safe filesystem path component: no `/` or `\` separators, no `.` or `..`, no leading drive letter or NUL byte, and no Windows-reserved characters. Unsafe ids are rejected with a clear error and the plugin is not installed.

```json
{
  "id": "unique.plugin.id",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "name": "Plugin Display Name",
  "description": "What your plugin does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "permissions": [
    "log",
    "api",
    "emit",
    "pluginStorage",
    "events.machine"
  ],
  "drivers": [
    {
      "id": "humidity",
      "type": "sensor"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "SettingName": {
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Setting name",
      "secure": false,
      "description": "Setting description"
    },
    "Roast": {
      "type": "enum",
      "label": "Roast degree",
      "values": ["Light", "Medium", "Dark"],
      "default": "Medium",
      "description": "Roast degree"
    }
  },
  "api": [
    {
      "id": "eventName",
      "type": "websocket",
      "data": {
        "field1": {
          "type": "number",
          "description": "Field description"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Manifest Fields

- **id**: Unique identifier using reverse domain notation (e.g., `com.example.plugin`)
- **permissions**: Array of capabilities the plugin needs:
  - `log`: Call `host.log`
  - `api`: Use plugin `fetch` and expose declared HTTP endpoints
  - `emit`: Call `host.emit`
  - `pluginStorage`: Call `host.storage`
  - `events.machine`: Receive `stateUpdate`
  - `events.shots`: Receive `shotStored` and `shotUpdated`
  - `events.workflow`: Receive `workflowUpdated`
  - `proxy.decent_api`: Send read requests through `host.decentProxy`
  - `proxy.decent_api.write`: Send allowlisted write requests through `host.decentProxy`
  - `network.websocket`: Open outbound WebSocket connections (`ws://` and `wss://`) through `host.transport`
  - `network.tcp`: Open outbound raw TCP connections through `host.transport`
  - `network.tls`: Open outbound TLS connections (platform trust store) through `host.transport`
- **drivers**: Device classes the plugin may register. Each declaration has a plugin-local `id` and a `type`. The only currently supported type is `sensor`. A manifest may declare at most 8 drivers. Driver declarations authorize registration; they do not grant transport access. For example, a WebSocket-backed sensor also needs `network.websocket`.
- **settings**: User-configurable options with `type` (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `enum`), an optional `label` giving the setting a human-friendly name, an optional `description` explaining what the setting does, an optional `default`, and an optional `secure` flag for credentials such as passwords. Enum `values` are a JSON array of strings. Secure values use platform credential storage, are supplied in memory to `onLoad(settings)`, and are never returned by the REST API.

  `GET /api/v1/plugins` returns this schema verbatim under `settings`, so a skin can render a settings form — labels, help text and defaults included — without reading the plugin's repository. `GET /api/v1/plugins/:id/settings` returns the stored values only.

  Write a `label` and a `description` for every setting. Without a `label`, clients fall back to the storage key, so a user sees `LengthThreshold` rather than "Minimum shot length"; the `description` is the only explanation they get.
- **api**: HTTP and WebSocket endpoints exposed by the plugin

Unknown permission names make the manifest invalid. Calls without their required
permission throw or reject with `PluginPermissionError` and are logged by Decaid.
`setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` are baseline runtime facilities and need no
manifest permission.

### 2. `plugin.js` - Main plugin implementation

```javascript
function createPlugin(host) {
  "use strict";

  // Internal state
  let state = {};

  function log(msg) {
    host.log(`[plugin-id] ${msg}`);
  }

  return {
    id: "unique.plugin.id",
    version: "1.0.0",

    onLoad(settings) {
      // Called when plugin loads
      // `settings` contains user-configured values
    },

    onUnload() {
      // Clean up resources
    },

    onEvent(event) {
      // Handle events from Flutter app
      // event.name: string, event.payload: object
    }
  };
}
```

## Host API

The `host` object provides these methods:

### `host.log(message)`
Log messages to the Flutter app's logger. Requires `log`.

### `host.emit(eventName, payload)`
Emit events to the Flutter app. Requires `emit`.

### `host.storage(command)`
Interact with persistent storage. Requires `pluginStorage`. Commands:
```javascript
// Read from storage
host.storage({
  type: "read",
  key: "keyName",
  namespace: "plugin.id"
});

// Write to storage
host.storage({
  type: "write",
  key: "keyName",
  namespace: "plugin.id",
  data: { foo: "bar" }
});
```

**Note:** namespace is not used by Decaid internally, the plugin storage is namespaced to the plugins' identifier.

### `host.decentProxy(path, options)`
Call the Decent account proxy without exposing stored credentials to plugin code. `GET` requires the read-only `proxy.decent_api` permission. `POST` requires the distinct write permission `proxy.decent_api.write` **and** is restricted to an explicit path allowlist (currently only `support/api/shot_upload`); other methods/paths are rejected and logged. The first request from each plugin id pauses for approval in Decaid's native UI. Explicit allow and deny decisions are remembered; denial or timeout rejects the call before any upstream request.

```javascript
const response = await host.decentProxy("support/api/sn", {
  method: "GET",
  query: { onlyespressomachines: "1" }
});

if (response.status === 200) {
  const serials = response.body.trim().split("\n");
}

// POST with a body (needs proxy.decent_api.write; only allowlisted write paths)
const upload = await host.decentProxy("support/api/shot_upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(shot),
  contentType: "application/json"
});
```

The returned object has `{ status, headers, body }`. Consent denial or non-decision rejects with `error.code === "account_consent_denied"`. `GET` (read) needs `proxy.decent_api`; `POST` (write) needs `proxy.decent_api.write` and a path on the write allowlist. Credentials are attached in Dart and never exposed to plugin JS.

## Events System

### Events from Flutter → Plugin

Plugins receive events in the `onEvent` method:

Machine broadcasts require `events.machine`. Shot lifecycle broadcasts require
`events.shots`. Workflow broadcasts require `events.workflow`.

- **`stateUpdate`**: Machine state changes (temperature, pressure, flow, etc.)

  ```javascript
  {
    name: "stateUpdate",
    payload: {
      groupTemperature: 93.5,
      targetGroupTemperature: 94.0,
      pressure: 9.2,
      flow: 2.1,
      // ... other machine metrics
    }
  }
  ```

- **`workflowUpdated`**: Contains exactly the current workflow serialization
  returned by `WorkflowController.currentWorkflow.toJson()`. A permitted plugin
  receives the current workflow when a controller is attached or replaced and
  after each successful load or reload. Later events are delivered when the
  workflow revision changes.

  ```javascript
  {
    name: "workflowUpdated",
    payload: {
      id: "workflow-id",
      name: "Espresso",
      description: "",
      profile: { /* profile fields */ },
      context: {
        targetDoseWeight: 18.0,
        targetYield: 36.0
      },
      steamSettings: { /* steam fields */ },
      hotWaterData: { /* hot-water fields */ },
      rinseData: { /* rinse fields */ }
    }
  }
  ```

- **`shutdown`**: Plugin is about to be unloaded
- **`storageRead`**: Response to a storage read request

  ```javascript
  {
    name: "storageRead",
    payload: {
      key: "lastUploadedShot",
      value: "shot-12345"
    }
  }
  ```

- **`storageWrite`**: Confirmation of storage write
- **`shotStored`**: A shot finished persisting
- **`shotUpdated`**: A stored shot was edited via `PUT /api/v1/shots/<id>` (e.g. metadata changes — notes, enjoyment, bean/grinder). Broadcast to every plugin so they can react to edits (the Visualizer plugin uses it to forward-sync edited metadata).

  ```javascript
  {
    name: "shotUpdated",
    payload: {
      id: "shot-12345",       // local shot id
      shot: { /* full shot without measurements */ },
      patch: { /* the partial update body that was PUT */ }
    }
  }
  ```

#### Visualizer Forward Sync

The bundled Visualizer plugin merges recipe and shot-review tags, reads the current Visualizer tags before replacing them, and forwards later local edits in order. Visualizer tag writes require a Visualizer Premium account. The upload endpoint returns `202` with `visualizer_id` after the Visualizer upload succeeds while the tag PATCH continues in memory. Follow-up failures, including Visualizer's premium-account rejection, are reported through `shotForwardSyncError` and `forwardSyncStatus`; tag ownership is restored after an app or plugin restart. Pending work is not restored though.

### Events from Plugin → Flutter

Plugins can emit custom events that the Flutter app can listen to:

```javascript
host.emit("timeToReady", {
  remainingTimeMs: 120000,
  heatingRate: 0.5,
  status: "heating",
  message: "02:00 remaining"
});
```

The event name is tied to the api endpoint, defined in the plugin manifest.
When Decaid matches an external request to an endpoint that is defined in the
plugins manifest,
it will send over events emitted by the plugin.

Example:

```bash
npx wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/ws/v1/plugins/time-to-ready.reaplugin/timeToReady

```
Will open a websocket through which Decaid will forward all the `timeToReady` events

## HTTP Requests

Plugins can make HTTP requests using the standard `fetch` API (polyfilled by the host):

Plugin `fetch` requires `api`. Declared HTTP endpoints also require `api` before
Decaid dispatches a request to the plugin.

```javascript
// Basic GET request
const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
const data = await response.json();

// POST with authentication
const authHeader = "Basic " + btoa(username + ":" + password);
const upload = await fetch("https://api.example.com/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": authHeader,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

**Note**: The JavaScript environment has limited APIs. Currently available:

- `fetch()` for HTTP requests
- `btoa()` for base64 encoding (polyfilled)
- Standard JavaScript language features

## BLE Declaration Work in Progress (#809)

Manifest parsing accepts the separate `transport.ble` permission, `scale`
driver type, Scale capabilities, and one `ble.match` declaration per plugin.
This branch does not yet implement runtime BLE binding. Public non-BLE Scale
registration is available as described below; end-to-end API and timing
acceptance remain in progress.
Accepting a declaration does not grant GATT access. See
`doc/plans/issue-809-design.md` for the remaining implementation and tests.

The matcher supports one case-insensitive `name` predicate (`exact`, `prefix`,
or `contains`, 1-248 characters), and/or `serviceUuids` (1-64 UUIDs). It does not
trim names. UUIDs accept 16-, 32-, and 128-bit forms and serialize as lowercase
128-bit UUIDs. Name and service predicates combine with AND; the service list
uses any-of semantics. Unknown keys and unconstrained matchers are invalid.

Incomplete evidence remains indeterminate. A complete observation proving a
required name is absent makes the matcher a non-match. The evidence cache keeps
complete observations over incomplete ones regardless of source, uses observation
time between equally complete records, and never merges records. A proven false
predicate makes the matcher a non-match. A definite match cannot win against an
indeterminate competing driver. Two definite matches conflict. Discovery and connection
admission still need to use these arbitration primitives.

### Non-BLE Scale Registration

Declare a Scale driver in the manifest. No `transport.ble` permission is needed:

```json
"drivers": [{"id": "memory", "type": "scale"}]
```

A minimal synthetic Scale plugin can register an instance during `onLoad`:

```javascript
function createPlugin(host) {
  return {
    id: "example.scale",
    onLoad() {
      return host.devices.register({
        driverId: "memory",
        instanceId: "one",
        name: "Memory Scale"
      }, {
        async connect(context) {
          await context.publish({weight: 0});
        },
        disconnect() {}
      });
    }
  };
}
```

Each connect invocation receives a fresh context with `transport`,
`publish(snapshot)`, and `reportDisconnected()`. Network `transport` uses the
existing invocation-owned transport API and requires the corresponding network
permission. Capture this context in protocol callbacks; do not look up a mutable
current context when a delayed callback runs. The host rejects stale-session
publications and failure reports. The persistent registration exposes `deviceId`
and `unregister()`, not publication or failure-reporting methods.

Scale disconnect remains in progress until the manager's bounded handler
invocation and host transport cleanup finish. Reconnect waits for that retirement,
including when the handler throws or times out. Host cleanup also closes transports
opened by a connect handler that already completed; old handles cannot send into
a replacement session. The adapter does not apply a separate disconnect timeout.

Weight is finite signed grams. Optional `battery` is an integer from 0 to 100;
omission or null means unknown, including in existing controller serialization.
Optional finite `flow` and nonnegative integer `timerMs` require `flow` and
`timerTelemetry` capabilities respectively. Battery requires `battery`.
Arbitrary timestamps and unknown publication fields are rejected.

Declare optional commands in manifest `capabilities`: `tare` requires a `tare`
handler; `timerControl` requires `startTimer`, `stopTimer`, and `resetTimer`;
`displayControl` requires `sleepDisplay` and `wakeDisplay`. Host registration
validates handlers against these declarations, including direct bridge calls.
Unsupported operations fail with `unsupported_operation`, not success.
Disconnect-to-sleep recovery policy is not yet complete in this branch.

Readiness requires both successful `connect` completion and a valid weight.
Up to 256 initialization samples are retained for controller activation, then
delivered once. Initialization is bounded; invalid samples cannot mark ready.
Publication-ingress timestamps are provisional pending the required timing gate.

## Network Transports (`host.transport`)

`host.transport` exposes permission-gated outbound network transports: WebSocket
(`ws://` / `wss://`), raw TCP and raw TLS. Decaid owns connection lifecycle,
permission enforcement, resource bounds and native cleanup; plugins and bundled
JavaScript libraries implement higher-level protocols such as MQTT on top of
these primitives.

Each transport requires its own manifest permission:

| `kind` | Permission | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| `websocket` | `network.websocket` | `ws://` and `wss://`; `wss://` uses normal platform certificate validation and does **not** require `network.tls` |
| `tcp` | `network.tcp` | raw byte stream |
| `tls` | `network.tls` | raw byte stream over TLS using the platform trust store only |

Permission failure rejects the `open()` call with a `PluginPermissionError`
before any DNS lookup or connection attempt. No unrestricted global `WebSocket`
or socket object exists in the JavaScript runtime; all network access goes
through `host.transport`.

### `host.transport.open(options)`

Resolves once the connection is established, with `{ handle, protocol }`. The
`handle` is an opaque string owned by the plugin id + generation that opened it.
`protocol` is present for WebSocket only, when a subprotocol was negotiated.

```js
const opened = await host.transport.open({
  kind: "websocket",
  url: "wss://broker.example/mqtt",
  protocols: ["mqtt"]          // optional WebSocket subprotocols
});
const handle = opened.handle;

const { handle: tcpHandle } = await host.transport.open({
  kind: "tcp",
  host: "192.168.1.10",
  port: 1883
});

const { handle: tlsHandle } = await host.transport.open({
  kind: "tls",
  host: "broker.example",
  port: 8883
});
```

WebSocket options: `kind: "websocket"`, `url` (required, `ws://` or `wss://`),
`protocols` (optional array of subprotocol strings). Arbitrary custom WebSocket
headers are not supported.

TCP/TLS options: `kind: "tcp"`/`"tls"`, `host` (required hostname/IP),
`port` (required integer 1..65535). Custom CA material and client
certificates are out of scope; TLS uses the platform trust store only.

Connection failures before establishment reject the `open()` Promise.

### `host.transport.onEvent(handle, callback)`

Registers the single event listener for a handle. Calling it again replaces the
previous listener. Events that arrive after `open()` resolves but before a
listener is registered are retained in the bounded inbound queue and delivered
in order once the listener is registered.

Data events:

```js
// WebSocket text frame
{ type: "data", dataType: "text", data: "plain text payload" }

// WebSocket binary frame, TCP bytes or TLS bytes (base64)
{ type: "data", dataType: "binary", data: "<base64>" }
```

TCP and TLS are byte streams and only emit `dataType: "binary"`. Text encoding,
line framing and request/response semantics belong to plugin/library adapters.

Error events (failures after the connection opened):

```js
{ type: "error", code: "transport_error", message: "human-readable description" }
```

Resource-limit failures use `code: "transport_resource_limit"`. A terminal
transport error is followed by deterministic cleanup; a close event may follow.

Close events:

```js
{ type: "close", code: 1000, reason: "..." }  // code/reason omitted when unavailable
```

Successful `open()` resolution is the connection-open notification; there is no
separate `open` event.

### `host.transport.send(handle, payload)`

Returns a Promise. WebSocket text send:

```js
await host.transport.send(handle, { type: "text", data: "hello" });
```

WebSocket binary, TCP and TLS send:

```js
await host.transport.send(handle, { type: "binary", data: "<base64>" });
```

For TCP/TLS, `type: "text"` is invalid; adapters must encode text to bytes
themselves. Binary data crosses the JS/Dart bridge as base64; WebSocket text
frames remain plain strings and are never base64 encoded.

The Promise resolves once the complete payload is accepted into the native
transport's bounded outbound write path. It does **not** mean the remote peer
received the payload. A send is atomic with respect to the queue limit: if
accepting the whole payload would exceed the outbound limit, the complete send
rejects with `error.code === "transport_resource_limit"`; nothing is partially
enqueued or silently dropped.

### `host.transport.close(handle)`

Returns a Promise that resolves after the native transport is closed and the
handle has been released. Already-accepted outbound frames are written before
the connection is closed; new sends after `close()` reject. Closing an
already-closed or stale handle may reject with a normal transport error; it
never affects another plugin or another generation of the same plugin.

### Resource bounds

- Maximum **8 live transports per plugin generation** (connecting, open and
  closing all count; a transport closed by the peer before `onEvent()` was
  registered also counts until its queued events are delivered). Opening one
  more rejects with `transport_resource_limit`.
- Maximum **1 MiB pending outbound data per transport**. A send that would
  exceed this rejects atomically with `transport_resource_limit`.
- Maximum **1 MiB queued inbound data per transport** waiting for JS delivery.
  Exceeding it closes that transport with a `transport_resource_limit` error;
  data is never silently discarded to stay under the bound.

### Lifecycle and ownership

Every handle is owned by the plugin id + plugin generation that opened it: a
handle cannot be used by another plugin, and cannot be reused by a newer
generation after a plugin reload. Stale native events from retired generations
are dropped. Plugin unload closes all transports owned by that generation even
if the plugin's `onUnload()` throws or never closes its connections, and
`PluginManager` disposal closes everything remaining. Localhost, LAN and
private-address destinations are allowed; there is no hostname/CIDR allow-list.

### Examples

WebSocket text echo:

```js
const opened = await host.transport.open({
  kind: "websocket",
  url: "ws://broker.example/echo"
});
host.transport.onEvent(opened.handle, (event) => {
  if (event.type === "data") {
    // event: { type: "data", dataType: "text", data: "..." }
  }
});
await host.transport.send(opened.handle, { type: "text", data: "hello" });
```

WebSocket binary echo:

```js
const opened = await host.transport.open({
  kind: "websocket",
  url: "ws://broker.example/echo"
});
host.transport.onEvent(opened.handle, (event) => {
  if (event.type === "data" && event.dataType === "binary") {
    // event.data is base64; decode it with your library of choice
  }
});
await host.transport.send(opened.handle, { type: "binary", data: btoa("bytes") });
```

TCP binary echo:

```js
const opened = await host.transport.open({
  kind: "tcp",
  host: "192.168.1.10",
  port: 1883
});
host.transport.onEvent(opened.handle, (event) => {
  if (event.type === "data") {
    // event: { type: "data", dataType: "binary", data: "<base64>" }
  }
});
await host.transport.send(opened.handle, { type: "binary", data: btoa("\x00\x01\x02") });
```

## Device Registration (`host.devices`)

A plugin with a declared sensor driver can register runtime sensor instances.
Registered sensors join Decaid's normal device inventory and sensor registry; no
plugin-specific endpoint is created. They are available through:

- `GET /api/v1/devices`
- `GET /api/v1/sensors`
- `GET /api/v1/sensors/:id`
- `POST /api/v1/sensors/:id/execute`
- `/ws/v1/sensors/:id/snapshot`

Registration and transport authorization are independent. The manifest below
allows a sensor registration and an outbound WebSocket connection:

```json
{
  "drivers": [{ "id": "humidity", "type": "sensor" }],
  "permissions": ["network.websocket"]
}
```

Register the sensor from `onLoad()`:

```js
let sensor;
let transportHandle;

async function registerSensor() {
  sensor = await host.devices.register({
    driverId: "humidity",
    instanceId: "office",
    name: "Office humidity",
    vendor: "Example",
    dataChannels: [
      { key: "relativeHumidity", type: "number", unit: "%RH" }
    ],
    commands: [
      {
        id: "sampleNow",
        name: "Sample now",
        paramsSchema: { type: "object" },
        resultsSchema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: { relativeHumidity: { type: "number" } }
        }
      }
    ]
  }, {
    async connect(transport) {
      const opened = await transport.open({
        kind: "websocket",
        url: "ws://sensor.local/readings"
      });
      transportHandle = opened.handle;
    },
    async disconnect() {
      if (transportHandle) await host.transport.close(transportHandle);
    },
    async execute(command) {
      if (command.commandId === "sampleNow") {
        return { relativeHumidity: 52.4 };
      }
      throw new Error("unknown command");
    }
  });

  await sensor.publish({ relativeHumidity: 52.4 });
}
```

Call `registerSensor()` from the plugin's `onLoad()` method.

`host.devices.register(definition, handlers)` returns a Promise for a device
handle with:

- `deviceId`: stable public identity derived from plugin id, driver id, and
  instance id; plugin generation is not part of the identity.
- `publish(snapshot)`: publishes one complete snapshot. Every declared channel
  must be present, values must match their declared JSON type, and undeclared
  channels are rejected.
- `reportDisconnected()`: marks the sensor disconnected after an unexpected
  transport or protocol failure.
- `unregister()`: removes the sensor from the device inventory.

All three handlers are required. Decaid calls `connect(transport)` when the
sensor joins the sensor registry. The invocation-bound `transport` has the same
methods as `host.transport`; connections opened through it belong to that
connect attempt across Promise continuations. Resolving means the driver is
ready to serve commands, not merely that its transport opened. `disconnect()`
performs normal driver cleanup
and is run before a device is removed: on explicit `unregister()` and on plugin
unload, so the driver can release its transport or other resources. A failing or
timed-out `disconnect()` still removes the device and rejects in-flight
commands; the failure is surfaced to the caller.
`execute({ commandId, params })` handles a declared command and returns an
object. Handler failures propagate through the existing sensor command API.
Calls time out after 10 seconds.

Definitions, snapshots, command parameters and command results are limited to
64 KiB of JSON. A plugin generation can register at most 8 devices. Registration
is not remembered across app restarts. On plugin unload, Decaid runs each
device's `disconnect()` handler, removes every device, and rejects in-flight
commands owned by the retiring generation, even if `onUnload()` fails. Late
publications and command results from older generations
are ignored. BLE-backed drivers use the separate binding contract below;
probing and grinder registration are not supported.

### BLE Driver Binding (`host.devices.bindDriver`)

Declare a BLE matcher and `transport.ble` permission, then bind its factory from
`onLoad()`. Binding does not open a connection or register a synthetic device.
The existing scanner selects physical candidates before invoking the factory.

```json
{
  "permissions": ["transport.ble"],
  "drivers": [{
    "id": "humidity",
    "type": "sensor",
    "ble": {"match": {"serviceUuids": ["180f"]}}
  }]
}
```

`await host.devices.bindDriver('humidity', {create(device) { ... }})` binds one
factory per plugin generation. `create` must synchronously return `connect`,
`disconnect`, and `execute` handlers plus Sensor `vendor`, `dataChannels`, and
`commands` metadata using the schema above. Async factories are rejected: all
hardware initialization belongs in `connect(context)`. The frozen factory input
contains `id`, `name`, and `advertisement` (`name`, `nameComplete`, `serviceUuids`,
`servicesComplete`). It has no publication or GATT authority.

The public ID is `plugin:<pluginId>:<driverId>:<normalizedPhysicalId>`, stable
across reloads and reconnects. Sensor inventory, commands, and snapshots use the
existing REST/WebSocket paths. Each connection receives a fresh context:

- `context.publish(snapshot)` and `context.reportDisconnected()` belong only to
  that connection. Retaining a context cannot authorize a replacement session.
- `context.gatt.discoverServices()` returns normalized 128-bit service UUIDs.
- `read(service, characteristic)` returns base64 bytes.
- `writeWithResponse(service, characteristic, base64)` and
  `writeWithoutResponse(service, characteristic, base64)` select acknowledgement
  explicitly. Unsupported acknowledged writes are not silently downgraded.
- `subscribe(service, characteristic, callback)` returns an object with an async
  `unsubscribe()`. The callback receives base64 bytes and may run before subscribe
  resolves. Replacing the same tuple resets native notifications; the old logical
  unsubscribe cannot remove the replacement.
- `onDisconnect(callback)` installs one terminal listener for the session.

These GATT methods are on `context.gatt`. UUID input accepts Bluetooth aliases
but native calls always use 128-bit UUIDs. The host establishes the physical BLE
session before `connect` runs. That acquisition and its platform recovery follow
the transport's own policy and are not bounded by the plugin invocation timeout;
the `connect` handler, and the readiness that resolves it, still are. Resolving
`connect` declares protocol
readiness. The plugin owns that readiness: a plugin that creates a first-packet
readiness promise must attach its own rejection handler when it creates it,
because startup can fail before the promise is awaited and a later link loss or
silence watchdog would otherwise reject an unobserved promise. The Bookoo
reference plugin shows that pattern. `disconnect({gatt})` receives separate,
bounded cleanup authority for
discover/read/write only. Link loss or adapter revocation skips protocol cleanup.
After retirement, normal GATT calls and publications fail even if a JavaScript
Promise never settles. Physical ownership remains reserved until native teardown
is confirmed; a cleanup deadline alone cannot authorize another connection.

Limits per session are 16 pending GATT operations, 8 subscriptions, 256 queued
notification events / 64 KiB, and 16 KiB per read or write. Notification overflow
retires the session rather than dropping protocol data silently. Production permits
one active physical binding per plugin generation. Definitions and Sensor payloads
retain the 64 KiB JSON limit. Bridge failures carry `code`, including
`stale_session`, `permission_denied`, `resource_limit`, `attribute_unavailable`,
`link_lost`, and `timeout`; other native BLE codes are preserved.

BLE Scale bindings reuse the Scale adapter and declared capability checks. The
opt-in Felicita Arc and Bookoo examples exercise BLE Scale bindings with fake GATT.
Felicita hardware verification covers live notifications, weight, tare, timer
commands, confirmed disconnect, reconnect/reselection, and observed cadence.
Bookoo hardware is optional follow-up work; its device-specific silence threshold
remains provisional.

## Serving HTTP Endpoints

An `api` entry with `"type": "http"` exposes the plugin at
`/api/v1/plugins/:id/:endpoint`. Decaid dispatches the request to the plugin's
`__httpRequestHandler`, which returns a response or a promise for one.

```json
"api": [
  { "id": "edit-shot", "type": "http", "data": {} }
]
```

```javascript
__httpRequestHandler: function (request) {
  const shotId = request.query.shotId;
  return {
    status: 200,
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" },
    body: renderPage(shotId)
  };
}
```

A `handleHttpRequest` method on the object `createPlugin` returns works the
same way — the loader aliases it to `__httpRequestHandler` at load.

The `request` object:

| Field | Type | Contents |
|-------|------|----------|
| `requestId` | string | Correlation id for this dispatch |
| `endpoint` | string | The endpoint `id` from the manifest |
| `method` | string | `GET`, `POST`, and so on |
| `headers` | object | Request headers |
| `body` | any | Parsed JSON request body, `null` when the body is empty |
| `query` | object | Query parameters, percent-decoded |

`query` carries every parameter of the request URL and is always present — an
empty object when the URL has none, so `request.query.name` is safe to read
without guarding. A caller can therefore name the record a page should open on:

```
GET /api/v1/plugins/my.reaplugin/edit-shot?shotId=<id>&return=/skin/history
```

`shotId` is a lookup key. `return` is a navigation target and carries its own
rules — see [The `return` parameter](#the-return-parameter) below. It is a
**skin-local path**, never a host and never an absolute URL.

### Reading parameters in a served page

Pages a plugin serves run in the browser on Decaid's API origin, so a page can
read the same URL client-side instead:

```javascript
const shotId = new URLSearchParams(location.search).get("shotId");
```

Prefer this for a page that fetches its data over the REST API; it keeps the
value out of the generated HTML.

Skins are served from a different browser origin than plugin pages, so a skin
cannot write a plugin page's `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`. A query
parameter on a top-level navigation is how a skin hands a plugin page its
subject; accept a `return` parameter for the way back.

Treat every parameter as untrusted input: never interpolate it into generated
HTML unescaped, and fall back to the page's normal empty state when the value
names nothing. Most parameters are then used as a lookup key against the REST
API. **`return` is the exception, and it needs its own rule**, because it is a
navigation target rather than a lookup key.

### The `return` parameter

`return` cannot be assigned to `location` as it arrives, for two reasons.

A plugin page runs on the **API origin**, and the skin runs on its **own**
origin, so a bare path like `/skin/history` resolves against the API origin and
lands nowhere. And accepting an absolute URL instead would be an open redirect:
a link could send the page to any host it liked.

So constrain the value, rebuild the origin from what the page already knows,
and check the result before you use it:

1. **Require a skin-local path.** It must start with a single `/`. Reject `//`,
   which is protocol-relative and means another host, and reject anything
   carrying a scheme. Treat this as a first filter, not as the guarantee.
2. **Rebuild the skin origin from the page's own host.** Keep the host the
   browser actually used and replace only the port, with the live `port` from
   `GET /api/v1/webui/server/status`. Do not build the origin from that
   response's `ip`: on Android it is the server's bind address, `0.0.0.0`,
   which is not an origin a browser can navigate to. The fixed `localhost:3000`
   entry point redirects the same way, preserving the request host and changing
   only the port.
3. **Parse the target, then check its origin.** `new URL(path, skinOrigin)` is
   not enough on its own. The URL parser treats `\` as `/` in an `http` URL and
   strips tab and newline characters before it parses, so a value such as
   `/\example.invalid` passes step 1 and still resolves to another host.
   Require `target.origin === skinOrigin.origin` before you return it.

```javascript
async function skinReturnUrl(raw) {
  // First filter: a single leading slash, and no scheme.
  if (!raw || !raw.startsWith("/") || raw.startsWith("//")) return null;

  const res = await fetch("/api/v1/webui/server/status");
  const { serving, port } = await res.json();
  if (!serving || !Number.isInteger(port)) return null;

  // Same host the browser used; only the port differs.
  const skinOrigin = new URL(location.href);
  skinOrigin.port = String(port);

  const target = new URL(raw, skinOrigin);
  return target.origin === skinOrigin.origin ? target.href : null;
}

const back = await skinReturnUrl(
  new URLSearchParams(location.search).get("return"),
);
// `back` is null when the skin is not being served, or when the target did not
// resolve onto the skin origin. Show the page's own way out instead.
```

**The skin origin is not fixed, so read it every time.** Decaid assigns the
skin server a port and reports it here; a page that remembers one from an
earlier visit can send the user to a port nothing is listening on.

## Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Plugin directory is copied to app storage
2. **Loading**: `createPlugin()` is called, then `onLoad(settings)`
3. **Running**: Plugin receives events via `onEvent()` and can emit events
4. **Unloading**: `onUnload()` is called for cleanup
5. **Removal**: Plugin files are deleted from storage

### Load watchdog

Decaid records consecutive load failures for each plugin. After three failures, auto-load is disabled so the plugin no longer runs on subsequent launches. A plugin whose load was interrupted by an app exit is disabled on the next launch immediately, which also covers JavaScript evaluation that blocks before Dart's one-second timeout can fire.

Disabled plugins remain installed and can be re-enabled from plugin settings or `POST /api/v1/plugins/:id/enable`. Re-enabling clears the failure count and gives the plugin a fresh attempt; a successful load also clears it.

## Example: Temperature Monitoring Plugin

```javascript
function createPlugin(host) {
  "use strict";

  let temperatureHistory = [];

  function log(msg) {
    host.log(`[temp-monitor] ${msg}`);
  }

  return {
    id: "com.example.tempmonitor",
    version: "1.0.0",

    onLoad(settings) {
      log("Temperature monitor loaded");
      // Load previous state from storage
      host.storage({
        type: "read",
        key: "history",
        namespace: "com.example.tempmonitor"
      });
    },

    onUnload() {
      log("Saving temperature history");
      host.storage({
        type: "write",
        key: "history",
        namespace: "com.example.tempmonitor",
        data: temperatureHistory
      });
    },

    onEvent(event) {
      if (event.name === "stateUpdate") {
        const temp = event.payload.groupTemperature;
        temperatureHistory.push({
          timestamp: Date.now(),
          temperature: temp
        });

        // Keep only last 100 readings
        if (temperatureHistory.length > 100) {
          temperatureHistory.shift();
        }

        // Emit if temperature exceeds threshold
        if (temp > 95) {
          host.emit("highTemperature", {
            temperature: temp,
            timestamp: Date.now()
          });
        }
      } else if (event.name === "storageRead") {
        if (event.payload.key === "history") {
          temperatureHistory = event.payload.value || [];
        }
      }
    }
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always wrap async operations in try-catch
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Clear timeouts/intervals in `onUnload()`
3. **Storage**: Use the plugin's ID as namespace for storage isolation
4. **Logging**: Use descriptive log messages with plugin identifier prefix
5. **Settings Validation**: Validate user settings in `onLoad()`
6. **State Management**: Keep plugin state in memory; persist to storage only what's necessary

## Development Workflow

1. Create a directory with your plugin ID (e.g., `myplugin.reaplugin/`)
2. Add `manifest.json` and `plugin.js` files
3. Test locally by placing in the app's plugin directory
4. Use `host.log()` for debugging
5. Package as a `.reaplugin` directory (or zip file) for distribution

## Machine Data Structure

When receiving `stateUpdate` events, the payload contains:

```javascript
{
  groupTemperature: 93.5,        // Current group head temperature (°C)
  targetGroupTemperature: 94.0,  // Target temperature (°C)
  mixTemperature: 92.8,          // Mix temperature (°C)
  targetMixTemperature: 93.5,    // Target mix temperature (°C)
  pressure: 9.2,                 // Current pressure (bar)
  targetPressure: 9.0,           // Target pressure (bar)
  flow: 2.1,                     // Current flow rate (ml/s)
  targetFlow: 2.0,               // Target flow rate (ml/s)
  state: {                       // Machine state
    substate: "preinfusion"      // Current substate
  },
  // Scale data if available
  scale: {
    weight: 18.5,                // Current weight (g)
    weightFlow: 1.8              // Weight-based flow rate (g/s)
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plugin not loading**: Check manifest `id` matches plugin directory name
2. **Storage not working**: Ensure `pluginStorage` permission is in manifest
3. **HTTP requests failing**: Verify network connectivity and CORS headers
4. **Events not received**: Check event names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Debugging

- Use `host.log()` extensively during development
- Check Flutter app logs for JavaScript errors
- Test with simple plugins first, then add complexity
- When iterating, it helps to debug on a platform that can access Decaid
documents. This way, you can edit plugin source directly and simply reload
it in Decaid UI.

## API Reference

### Available in JavaScript Runtime

- **Global Functions**: `fetch()`, `btoa()`, `setTimeout()`, `clearTimeout()`
- **Objects**: `Promise`, `JSON`, `Math`, `Date`, `Array`, `Object`
- **Constants**: `undefined`, `null`, `Infinity`, `NaN`
- **Host API**: `host.log()`, `host.emit()`, `host.storage()`, `host.decentProxy()`, `host.transport`, `host.devices`

### Not Available

- `XMLHttpRequest`, `FormData`, `Blob`, `FileReader`
- `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `indexedDB`
- DOM APIs (`document`, `window`, etc.)
- Node.js modules (`require`, `module`, `process`)

## Security Considerations

- Plugins run in a sandboxed JavaScript environment
- HTTP requests are proxied through Flutter (respects system proxy settings)
- Outbound WebSocket/TCP/TLS connections go through `host.transport`, which
  requires the matching `network.websocket` / `network.tcp` / `network.tls`
  permission, enforces per-plugin connection and byte limits, and closes all
  connections on plugin unload or app shutdown. There is no unrestricted
  global `WebSocket` or socket API in the plugin runtime.
- TLS uses the platform trust store only; custom CA material and client
  certificates are not supported
- Storage is isolated per plugin
- No filesystem access beyond the plugin's own directory
- HTTP/fetch cannot reach localhost or private IPs (except for the Decaid
  API); `host.transport` has no such restriction

## External First-Party Plugins

DYE2 ships from [decentespresso/dye2](https://github.com/decentespresso/dye2), the Decent shot upload plugin ships from [decentespresso/shot-upload](https://github.com/decentespresso/shot-upload), and the dcamp community plugin ships from [decentespresso/decaid-dcamp-plugin](https://github.com/decentespresso/decaid-dcamp-plugin). Each repository publishes a `.reaplugin` directory as a release ZIP. CI and local setup run `scripts/fetch_dye2_plugin.sh`, `scripts/fetch_shot_upload_plugin.sh`, and `scripts/fetch_dcamp_plugin.sh` to download pinned releases, verify their checksums and manifest contracts, and unpack them into `assets/plugins/`. Bump a plugin's pinned version and checksum in a normal PR when its repository publishes a new release.

`packages/dye2-plugin/` still holds the DYE2 plugin's original TypeScript + Vite source and is useful as a reference for advanced patterns (REST API client, HTML template rendering, Vite dev server — see `packages/dye2-plugin/README.md`), but it is **not** built or bundled by Decaid anymore and is not authoritative for what ships. Treat the external repositories as the source of truth; update the in-tree DYE2 copy only if it is being kept in sync deliberately.

## Distribution and Updates

A plugin can be installed from four sources:

| Source | Tracked | Updates |
|--------|---------|---------|
| GitHub release | yes | new release tag |
| GitHub branch | yes | new commit on the branch |
| Local ZIP | no | none, it is a snapshot |
| Local folder | no | none, it is a snapshot |

Every install goes through the same validation: the package must resolve to a
single plugin root holding both `manifest.json` and `plugin.js`, the manifest
must parse, and the id must be a single safe path component. A GitHub archive or
a release ZIP may wrap its content in one directory; more than one candidate
root is rejected rather than guessed.

Provenance for a tracked install is stored in a Decaid-owned
`.rea_source.json` inside the plugin directory. It is not part of your plugin
package, it is rewritten on every install, and it disappears when the plugin is
removed.

### Packaging a release

For a GitHub release install:

- tag the release `X.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z`;
- the tag must equal `manifest.json`'s `version` after removing the leading `v`,
  so `v1.4.0` requires `"version": "1.4.0"`. A mismatch is rejected;
- attach exactly one `.zip` asset holding the plugin, either flat or inside one
  wrapper directory. If a release carries several `.zip` assets, the installer
  refuses to guess and the caller must name the asset.

Branch installs have no tag rule. The resolved commit is the update signal, so a
branch-backed plugin updates when the branch moves even if `version` never
changes.

```bash
curl -X POST http://tablet:8080/api/v1/plugins/install/github-release \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"repo": "acme/my-plugin"}'

curl -X POST http://tablet:8080/api/v1/plugins/install/github-branch \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"repo": "acme/my-plugin", "branch": "dev"}'
```

### Update rules

Tracked plugins are checked on the app's normal update cadence, next to WebUI
skin updates, and on demand from the Plugins settings screen or
`POST /api/v1/plugins/update`. For each plugin:

- an unchanged tag or commit only refreshes `lastChecked`;
- a changed tag or commit is downloaded and validated before anything installed
  is touched. A branch is resolved to a commit first and that commit's archive
  is what gets downloaded, so a branch that moves mid-check cannot install
  contents the recorded SHA does not describe;
- an update must carry the plugin being updated: a candidate whose manifest id
  differs from the installed plugin is rejected before anything is touched;
- downgrade protection applies to release and branch updates alike: a lower
  version is rejected, and going back requires removing the plugin first. A
  moved branch whose manifest version is unchanged still updates;
- the swap is transactional. The plugin is unloaded only once the replacement is
  ready, and a failed copy or a failed reload restores the previous files,
  manifest and running plugin;
- settings, secure settings and the auto-load preference survive an update. A
  running plugin is restarted on the new version; a disabled one stays disabled;
- one plugin's failure never stops the others; the failure is recorded in
  `lastError`.

### Bundled plugins

A bundled plugin is copied out of the app at startup and stays the app-owned
floor: a newer bundled version replaces an older installed copy, an equal or
older one does not.

Bundled plugins published from a GitHub repo also take part in normal update
checks. `bundledPluginRepos` in `plugin_source_service.dart` maps DYE2, shot
upload, and dcamp to their canonical repositories. The first update check or visit to the
Plugins screen seeds `.rea_source.json` as a `github_release` source tagged with
the installed manifest version. Existing installs from before source tracking
are seeded the same way, so both plugins start receiving releases without a
reinstall. The seeder also realigns the recorded tag when a newer bundled copy
has been laid down, and never touches metadata that points somewhere else, so a
plugin the user pointed at a fork or branch keeps that source.

No asset name is recorded for a bundled seed because release asset names include
the version. The installer picks the release's single `.zip`, and a release with
several zip assets asks for an explicit choice.

### Permission escalation

An automatic update installs only when the candidate manifest requests the same
permissions as the installed version or fewer. If it asks for anything new, the
update is not installed. It is recorded as a `pendingUpdate` carrying the
candidate version and the added permissions, shown in the Plugins settings
screen and in `GET /api/v1/plugins`, and installed only after explicit approval:

```bash
curl -X POST http://tablet:8080/api/v1/plugins/my.reaplugin/update/approve
```

Approval is bound to the exact candidate that was reviewed. The pending release
tag or commit is the fetch target, not "whatever is latest now", and the fetched
candidate is revalidated - same plugin id, same version, no permission beyond
the approved ones - before anything is installed. A source that moved between
detection and approval is refused with a 409, the new candidate is recorded as
the pending update, and its delta has to be approved in turn.

A pending update the app has already overtaken is cleared: when a newer bundled
copy lands at or above the pending version, the stale approval prompt goes away.
A genuinely newer pending update is kept.

Trusting a repository is not the same as trusting a new permission, so this
holds regardless of where the plugin came from.

## Plugin Lifecycle Management (REST API)

Plugins can be managed via REST API:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/plugins` | List all plugins (includes `loaded`, `autoLoad`, `source`, `pendingUpdate` fields) |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/enable` | Load plugin + enable auto-load on startup |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/disable` | Unload plugin + disable auto-load |
| PUT | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/source` | Create or overwrite `manifest.json` + `plugin.js` |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/plugins/:id` | Remove plugin (unload + delete files) |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/install` | Not supported (501); use the GitHub endpoints below |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/install/github-release` | Install from a GitHub release asset |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/install/github-branch` | Install from a GitHub branch |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/update` | Check every GitHub-backed plugin for updates |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/update/approve` | Install an update that requests new permissions |
| GET | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/settings` | Get plugin settings |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/settings` | Update plugin settings; reloads the plugin if it is loaded so the change applies immediately |

`PUT /api/v1/plugins/:id/source` writes `manifest.json` and `plugin.js` for
that id, creating the plugin if it is not installed yet:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://tablet:8080/api/v1/plugins/my.reaplugin/source \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"manifest": {"id": "my.reaplugin", "name": "My plugin", "author": "me", "description": "", "version": "1.1.0", "apiVersion": 1, "permissions": ["log"], "settings": {}, "api": []}, "plugin": "function createPlugin() { return { id: \"my.reaplugin\", onLoad() {} }; }"}'
```

Rules:

- The manifest id must match the path id (400 otherwise).
- The update is partial. Only `manifest.json` and `plugin.js` are written; any
  other file in the plugin directory survives. Plugins that need new extra
  files still have to be installed from a directory.
- Downgrades are rejected with 409. The submitted version must be greater than
  or equal to the installed version; installing an older version requires
  removing the plugin first. Versions compare as semantic versions, so
  `1.0.0-rc.1` ranks below `1.0.0`. The same comparison decides whether a
  bundled plugin replaces an installed copy at startup.
- The swap is transactional for a loaded plugin: it is unloaded, replaced, and
  reloaded, and if the new source fails to load the previous manifest, source,
  and running plugin are restored and the request returns 500.
- A plugin that was not loaded stays unloaded, and its new source is not
  executed or validated.
- Stored settings and the auto-load preference are preserved.
- Overwriting a bundled plugin holds only until the next app start, where the
  bundled copy wins if its version is higher.
- Updates, installs, removals, loads, and unloads for one plugin id are
  serialized against each other.
- Like `/settings`, this path shadows a plugin-declared endpoint named
  `source`.

The endpoint accepts arbitrary JavaScript that Decaid then runs in-process. It
is not covered by the account-proxy bearer token, so anyone who can reach the
API server on the LAN can install or replace plugin code. Run the API server
only on networks you trust.

Settings updates are patches for every field: an omitted field preserves the
existing value, `null` clears it, and for secure fields a `{ "isSet":
true|false }` marker preserves the stored credential. GET and POST responses
contain only the marker for secure fields, never the submitted or stored
value. Existing cleartext secure fields are moved out of SharedPreferences on
first read.

The bundled **settings plugin** (`settings.reaplugin`) provides a web UI for plugin management at `/api/v1/plugins/settings.reaplugin/ui`. It includes an enable/disable toggle and remove button for each plugin, with a self-protection guard that prevents disabling itself.

The bundled **Decent shot upload plugin** (`shot-upload.reaplugin`) is fetched
from the pinned [decentespresso/shot-upload](https://github.com/decentespresso/shot-upload)
release; that repository is the source of truth. The plugin keeps the
`shotStored` fast path and also scans the paginated local shot library in bounded
batches, newest first, while the machine is idle, scheduled idle, or sleeping.
It uses `annotations.extras.uploaded_to_decent` as the durable success marker and
prefers the capture-time identity in `workflow.machine`. Newly recorded shots set
`workflow.machine.provenanceStatus` to `captured` or `unavailable`. Only legacy
records where that field is absent use the currently connected real machine,
matching 0.2.0; unavailable or captured simulated identities are never replaced
by that fallback during automatic reconciliation. An explicit manual upload may
use the currently connected real machine when capture was unavailable. A
shot-specific rejected response is recorded in
`annotations.extras.decent_upload_rejected`, while transient failures are retried
on a later reconciliation pass. If the local annotation write fails, successful
uploads and permanent rejections are suppressed in memory for the rest of the
plugin session; after restart one later idempotent retry is possible. In 0.2.1
backlog reconciliation follows `AutoUpload`; the removed 0.2.0 `DrainHistory`
setting no longer gates it. Consent denial or non-decision pauses reconciliation
without a periodic retry.

## Next Steps

1. Review the example plugins in `assets/plugins/` and the DYE2 plugin at [decentespresso/dye2](https://github.com/decentespresso/dye2)
2. Start with a simple plugin that logs `stateUpdate` events
3. Add settings and persistent storage
4. Implement HTTP communication with external services
5. Emit custom events for the Flutter UI to display

For questions or issues, refer to the example plugins or check the app logs for error messages.
