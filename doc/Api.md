# API Reference

Scale REST command failures preserve the existing HTTP 500 response and `error`
message. Plugin Scale failures additionally include `code`; unsupported optional
operations use `unsupported_operation`. Native timer no-op behavior is unchanged.
The four tare/timer 500 responses share the OpenAPI `ScaleCommandError` schema.

Decaid exposes REST and WebSocket APIs on port 8080. Full OpenAPI specs are in [`assets/api/rest_v1.yml`](../assets/api/rest_v1.yml) and [`assets/api/websocket_v1.yml`](../assets/api/websocket_v1.yml). Interactive docs are available at port 4001 when the app is running.

For skin development, see [`doc/Skins.md`](Skins.md). For plugin development, see [`doc/Plugins.md`](Plugins.md).

The #809 work-in-progress manifest schema includes `transport.ble`, Scale
capabilities, and BLE matchers. Public non-BLE Scale registration is implemented;
runtime BLE binding and full API acceptance remain incomplete. See
[the active design](plans/issue-809-design.md). This stage
adds no routes or WebSocket messages.

---

## Admission control

Decaid rejects excess local API work rather than queueing it. `/api/` requests
allow 128 concurrent globally and 32 per client, with fixed one-second accepted
request limits of 1024 globally and 256 per client. Per-client rejection is `429`;
global rejection is `503`. Both include `Retry-After: 1`. `OPTIONS`, static/WebUI,
and `/ws/` requests do not use these API slots.

WebSocket admission is separate: 128 open connections globally, 32 per client,
and one-second upgrade limits of 128 globally and 32 per client. Rejected upgrades
use the same `429`/`503` and `Retry-After: 1` contract. Closing a socket releases its
connection slot.

Endpoints that buffer request bodies enforce byte and read-time limits. Small
control payloads use 64 KiB and 10 seconds, ordinary JSON payloads use 1 MiB and
30 seconds. Oversized bodies return `413`; bodies that miss their read deadline
return `408`. Firmware, workflow, and data-transfer endpoints retain their
documented limits.

---

## Conditional GETs (ETag / If-None-Match)

The following list endpoints set a strong `ETag` on every `200 OK` response and honour `If-None-Match` with `304 Not Modified` (empty body) when the client's tag matches:

- `GET /api/v1/beans`
- `GET /api/v1/beans/{beanId}/batches`
- `GET /api/v1/grinders`
- `GET /api/v1/profiles`
- `GET /api/v1/shots` (per query-param combination — filters and pagination are part of the tag)

Usage:

```bash
# First request — note the ETag
curl -is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/beans

# Re-request with If-None-Match — 304 if nothing changed
curl -is -H 'If-None-Match: "abc123…"' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/beans
```

Tags are SHA-256 derived from the encoded response body. Single-resource GETs and mutation routes do **not** emit ETags.

For browser clients on a different origin, `ETag` is exposed via `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`.

## REST API

### Machine

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/info` | Machine model, firmware, features | `de1handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/state` | Current machine state + substate. The steam substates `pausedSteam` and `puffing` report as themselves; both used to report as `idle` | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/machine/state/{newState}` | Request state change (`idle`, `sleep`, `espresso`, …) | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/settings` | DE1 machine settings (temps, flows) | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/settings` | Update machine settings (one grouped, serialized device write per request) | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/shotSettings` | Update shot settings (steam temp, hot water, target volume, group temp) | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/settings/advanced` | Advanced heater/phase settings | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/settings/advanced` | Update advanced settings (heater phase flows/timeouts, idle temp, `heaterVoltage`, `refillKitSetting`). `refillKitSetting` is an override (`0` force off, `1` force on, `2` auto) and is not persisted — Decaid writes auto at connect, so it lasts only for the current connection. It is not detection: `GET /api/v1/machine/info` -> `extra.refillKit` reports what the machine detected | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/machine/settings/reset` | Reset machine settings to defaults (fan, heater idle/phase flows + ph2 timeout, refill kit auto, flow multiplier 1.0, steam purge 0) — one grouped, serialized device write | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/calibration` | Flow estimation calibration (`flowMultiplier`, calFlowEst MMR) | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/calibration` | Update flow estimation calibration | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/calibration/{target}` | Read DE1 sensor calibration for `flow`/`pressure`/`temperature`, `?source=current\|factory`. Read responses carry the calibration value in `measuredValue` (`de1ReportedValue` is 1.0 for flow/pressure, 0.0 for temperature) | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/machine/calibration/{target}` | Write DE1 sensor calibration for `flow`/`pressure`/`temperature`. Writes are corrections, not sets: flow/pressure multiply the stored value by `measuredValue/de1ReportedValue`, temperature adds `measuredValue−de1ReportedValue`. To set an absolute value, read current `C` first, then write `{de1ReportedValue: C, measuredValue: X}` | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/profile` | Upload profile to machine | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/firmware` | Firmware catalog with per-artifact eligibility | `firmware_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/firmware` | Raw firmware upload (NDJSON progress stream) | `firmware_handler.dart` |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/machine/firmware` | Cancel in-progress firmware update (idempotent) | `firmware_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/firmware/apply` | Managed firmware apply: resolve, validate, upload | `firmware_handler.dart` |
| — | USB charger | Controlled via `POST /api/v1/machine/settings` with `{"usb": "enable"}` or `{"usb": "disable"}` | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/waterLevels` | Update water level threshold | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/capabilities` | List capability identifiers supported by the connected machine. Bengle returns the full set: `cupWarmer`, `integratedScale`, `stopAtWeight`, `ledStrip`, `scaleCalibration`, `preheat`, `wakeSchedule`; plain DE1 returns an empty list | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/cupWarmer` | Read cup-warmer state: setpoint (whole °C), manual `enabled`, live `currentTemperature` — Bengle only, 404 elsewhere | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/machine/cupWarmer` | Set setpoint (whole °C, 0–80) and/or `enabled`; temperature-only requests also enable manual heating (back-compat), `enabled:false` keeps the setpoint — Bengle only | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/cupWarmer/preheat` | Read scheduled pre-warm `enabled`/`leadMinutes`/`active` (firmware-owned timing) — Bengle only, 404 elsewhere | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/machine/cupWarmer/preheat` | Set pre-warm `enabled` and/or `leadMinutes` (0–120, persisted in firmware) — Bengle only | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/ledStrip` | Read LED strip palette (3 zones × 2 modes, 16-bit RGB; `frontSwitch` derived, not a hardware control); 503 until firmware hydration succeeds — Bengle only | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/machine/ledStrip` | Write palette write-through to FW registers (persisted immediately; `frontSwitch` ignored). The 200 body is the canonical stored palette — strips quantized to the firmware's 8 bits per channel, `frontSwitch` derived — replacing the former `{"status":"accepted"}` acknowledgement, which now only appears if the machine reports no stored palette after the write — Bengle only | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/ledStrip/commit` | Compatibility no-op (palette writes are already persisted) — Bengle only | |
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/ledStrip/reset` | Re-read palette from FW and return refreshed state (truthful reload, not a rollback) — Bengle only | |
| GET | `/api/v1/machine/scaleCalibration` | Read decoded scale-calibration state (step, cell, sub-state, seconds remaining, status) — Bengle only, 404 elsewhere | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/machine/scaleCalibration` | Start `zero`/`latch`/`abort` calibration step (`weightGrams` 1–10000 required for `latch`); 202 accepted / 409 rejected (busy or shot in progress) — Bengle only | |

#### Firmware updates

The catalog endpoint is available offline and without a connected machine. It returns bundled artifact metadata, compatibility and version eligibility, the recommended artifact, tri-state `updateAvailable`, and the shared machine operation state. The bundled Phase 1 artifact is official DE1 firmware build 1352 for `DE1Pro`, `DE1XL`, `DE1XXL`, and `DE1XXXL`.

Managed apply accepts `{"artifactId":"de1-1352","force":false}` with a 64 KiB body limit and a 10-second body-read timeout. The complete image is checked against its manifest, SHA-256 digest, canonical DE1 header, and connected model before erase. `force` permits reinstall or downgrade, including when the installed build is unknown, but never bypasses integrity or model checks. The raw endpoint retains its developer/recovery role and accepts `application/octet-stream`, capped at 16 MiB with a 60-second body-read timeout.

Raw and managed updates return `application/x-ndjson`. Events are ordered `erasing`, zero or more `uploading`, then `done`; failures after streaming starts terminate with `error`. Upload progress is emitted in approximately one-percent increments. The stream remains open during final machine verification, and `done` is sent only after the DE1 reports `FF FF FD`. The app waits for that value on the machine's notification and on a bounded poll of the firmware-map register, whichever answers first, so an update still completes on firmware that never sends the terminal notification. The erase and verify waits stay bounded, so a stuck update fails rather than hangs. Client disconnect and `DELETE` cancel a pending update before it starts or forward cancellation to an active update.

Pre-stream responses are `400` for malformed input, `404` for an unknown artifact, `408` when a request body stalls, `409` for an active update, `413` when a raw upload exceeds 16 MiB or a managed request exceeds 64 KiB, `422` for validation or policy rejection, and `503` when apply requires a machine or the machine write queue is full. Idempotent cancellation returns `202` with `{"operation":{"state":"idle"}}` when no update remains active.

### Scale

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/scale/info` | Information for the currently connected scale | `scale_handler.dart` |
| PUT | `/api/v1/scale/tare` | Tare the connected scale | `scale_handler.dart` |
| PUT | `/api/v1/scale/timer/start` | Start scale timer | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/scale/timer/stop` | Stop scale timer | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/scale/timer/reset` | Reset scale timer | |

`GET /api/v1/scale/info` is scoped to the currently connected scale. It returns `503` when no scale is connected and `{}` when connected metadata is not yet known. `firmwareVersion`, when present, is an opaque value reported by the scale (for example `R029`). `batteryLevel` is optional and nullable; unknown values are omitted, while `0` and `100` are valid readings. This endpoint is separate from device inventory.

### Devices

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/devices` | List devices (present + remembered) | `devices_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/devices/scan` | Scan and fill missing device slots; set `?connect=false` for discovery only | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/devices/connect` | Connect to device by ID | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/devices/disconnect` | Disconnect device | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/devices/forget` | Forget a remembered device | |
| GET | `/api/v1/devices/wifi` | List manually-added WiFi scale endpoints | `wifi_scale_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/devices/wifi` | Add a WiFi scale by IP/hostname (`{host}`) | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/devices/wifi` | Remove a manual WiFi endpoint (`{host}` body or `?host=`) | |

`/api/v1/devices/scan` keeps the existing query shape and defaults:
`connect=true` when omitted and `quick=false` when omitted. With connection
enabled, the request scans first, preserves occupied slots, then fills missing
machine and scale slots; this may take longer than the former quick-connect
behavior. `quick=true` returns immediately but does not change that policy.

`PUT /api/v1/devices/connect` waits for the attempt and returns `deviceId`,
`operation`, `outcome`, the resulting device `state`, and a structured
`connectionError` when applicable. Connected and already-connected devices return
200; conflicting or stale requests return 409; transport failures return 503;
and connection timeouts return 504. The devices WebSocket returns the same result
after each connect command.

Each device entry carries an **`available`** boolean. `true` = currently present
in discovery or actively connected; `false` = a **remembered** device that isn't
present (reported with `state: "disconnected"`). Devices the user connects to are
remembered and persist across restarts, shown as unavailable when offline, until
forgotten via `PUT /api/v1/devices/forget` (deviceId in the JSON body or
`?deviceId=` query). The same `available` field is on each device in the
`ws/v1/devices` snapshot.

`GET /api/v1/devices` and `/ws/v1/devices` are inventory-only surfaces. Their device entries contain identity, availability, and connection state, not connection metadata such as `deviceInfo`, `firmwareVersion`, or `batteryLevel`. A metadata refresh therefore does not emit an inventory update. Clients that need current connected-scale metadata should call `GET /api/v1/scale/info`; no scale metadata WebSocket is defined until a concrete live-update need exists.

`available` describes inventory presence, not command ownership. A connected
controller-owned device such as Bengle's integrated virtual scale is listed as
available but is inventory-only: REST connect/disconnect returns 409 and the
devices WebSocket returns an explicit error. Its lifecycle follows the Bengle
machine; use the scale API for operations such as tare.

**Manual WiFi scale endpoints.** Auto-discovered (DNS-SD) WiFi scales appear in
`GET /api/v1/devices` like any other device and need no extra calls. The
`/api/v1/devices/wifi` routes are only for *manually* entering a scale by IP or
hostname (e.g. on networks where mDNS is blocked). All three return
`{ "endpoints": [<host>, ...] }`. An added endpoint surfaces in the device list
as a "Half Decent Scale (WiFi)" entry and validates through the normal
recognition gate — a bad/unreachable address shows as a scale that never
reaches `connected`.

### Shots

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/shots` | Paginated list with filtering | `shots_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/shots/ids` | All shot IDs | |
| GET | `/api/v1/shots/latest` | Most recent shot | |
| GET | `/api/v1/shots/:id` | Get shot by ID (with measurements) | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/shots/:id` | Update shot annotations | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/shots/:id` | Delete shot | |

Newly recorded shots snapshot `serialNumber`, `model`, `firmwareVersion`, and
`flowCalibration` under `workflow.machine`. Historical records may omit these
fields. Consumers must not infer missing capture-time identity from the machine
that happens to be connected when a record is read.

**Modification tracking.** Every shot carries `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
(ISO-8601 UTC, always serialized with a trailing `Z`). `createdAt` is set
when the shot enters local storage; the extraction `timestamp` is the fallback
for legacy records that predate the field. Both fields are system-managed: a
`PUT /api/v1/shots/:id` body containing either is rejected with 400, so
clients cannot spoof revision metadata. `updatedAt` advances only when shot
*content* changes: `PUT /api/v1/shots/:id` bumps it iff the merged record
differs outside the bookkeeping keys. The bookkeeping keys are
`uploaded_to_decent`, `decent_upload_rejected`, and `visualizerId` inside
`annotations.extras` (the reserved scratch space for plugin sync state).
Writes confined to those keys persist without touching `updatedAt`, so
consumers can reconcile edits by comparing `updatedAt` against their own sync
marker without feedback loops.
An `extras` map emptied by that exclusion compares equal to no `extras`, and
an `annotations` map emptied by it compares equal to no `annotations`, so the
first-ever sync marker on a clean shot does not dirty it. All other `extras`
keys count as content. `measurements` is not editable through this endpoint:
a PUT body containing it is rejected with 400. Sync import with
`onConflict: overwrite` replaces the whole record, so its comparison
includes `measurements` (which overwrite can change, unlike PUT): the
existing `createdAt` is preserved, and `updatedAt` advances whenever the
imported record differs from the stored one, so a no-op re-import cannot
move a consumer's cursor backwards.

### Steams

Recorded milk-steaming sessions. Each record is opened when the machine
enters `steam` and finalized when it leaves. `SteamSnapshot.milkTemperature`
uses the preferred Bengle milk probe when its declared temperature channel is
available, and is `null` when no suitable sensor is registered.
`SteamSettings.stopAtTemperature` (in
`/api/v1/workflow`) is the target the future FW-autonomous stop or
in-app stop will trigger on.

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/steams` | List all steam records (no measurements) | `steams_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/steams/ids` | All steam record IDs | |
| GET | `/api/v1/steams/latest` | Most recent steam record (no measurements) | |
| GET | `/api/v1/steams/:id` | Get steam record by ID (with measurements) | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/steams/:id` | Update steam record annotations | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/steams/:id` | Delete steam record | |

### Profiles

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/profiles` | List all profiles | `profile_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/profiles/defaults` | List bundled default profiles (filename + metadata) | |
| GET | `/api/v1/profiles/:id` | Get profile by content-hash ID | |
| POST | `/api/v1/profiles` | Create new profile | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/profiles/:id` | Update profile (in-place; hash change replaces the record) | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/profiles/:id` | Soft-delete profile (defaults hidden, user profiles soft-deleted) | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/profiles/:id/visibility` | Change profile visibility | |
| GET | `/api/v1/profiles/:id/lineage` | Get profile version history | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/profiles/:id/purge` | Permanently delete (user profiles only) | |
| GET | `/api/v1/profiles/export` | Export all profiles as JSON | |
| POST | `/api/v1/profiles/import` | Import profiles from JSON | |
| POST | `/api/v1/profiles/restore/:filename` | Restore a bundled default by manifest filename | |

Profile updates use tri-state patch semantics: omitting `metadata` preserves it,
`metadata: null` clears it, and an object replaces it. The profile itself is
non-nullable; `profile: null` returns `400`.

### Workflow

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/workflow` | Get current workflow (profile + context) | `workflow_handler.dart` |
| PUT | `/api/v1/workflow` | Update workflow (one ordered deep-merge mutation) | `workflow_handler.dart` |

Each `PUT /api/v1/workflow` is one independent mutation. Requests run in FIFO order without
cross-request or cross-client coalescing. Partial updates are deep-merged against the latest
workflow state when each request executes, and each response contains that request's resulting
workflow. Omitted steam-setting fields are preserved and supplied values replace them. The
`steamSettings` object and all of its fields are non-nullable; explicit `null` returns `400`.
The `context` object is validated against `WorkflowContextPatch`, which is not the stored
`WorkflowContext`: every context field still accepts an explicit `null` to clear it, except
`context.targetYield`, which returns `400`. `targetYield` is the single source of truth for
stop-at-weight and null and `0` both mean the feature is off, so omit the field to keep the
current value, or send `0` to turn stop-at-weight off deliberately; a value that is not a
number returns `400` rather than clearing the target. The `context` object itself is
non-nullable too — `{"context": null}` returns `400`, because dropping the whole context
would clear `targetYield` with it, so clearing is per field. A stored or returned workflow
keeps a nullable `targetYield`.
Requests may wait behind machine I/O; the server does not debounce high-frequency
input, so clients should throttle controls themselves. Bodies larger than 1 MiB return `413`,
requests beyond the eight-entry active/queued limit return `429`, and requests waiting more
than 30 seconds for execution return `503` without being applied. Machine-write failures
return an error before the controller workflow is committed. Multi-step machine writes may
be partially applied, and retrying the same request re-attempts the requested settings.
Request bodies have a 30-second read timeout; body-read failures return `408`
without poisoning later queued mutations. DE1 writes allow one active operation and
32 pending operations; a full device queue returns `503`. Pending rinse, steam, and
hot-water settings coalesce by component, and a superseded workflow request returns
`409`. A replaceable setting may reconcile after reconnect only when the machine
identity matches; failure to reconnect within the bounded wait returns `503`.
Imperative writes are not replayed after a disconnect. In each failure case, the
workflow is not committed. A `stopAtTemperature`-only workflow change never touches
the DE1 directly — the Bengle bridge applies it
asynchronously — so it commits even while no machine is connected.

### Beans

Bean, bean-batch, and grinder updates use tri-state patch semantics: omitted
fields preserve stored values, explicit `null` clears nullable fields, and
supplied values replace them. Explicit `null` for non-nullable fields returns
`400`.

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/beans` | List all beans | `beans_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/beans` | Create bean | |
| GET | `/api/v1/beans/:id` | Get bean | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/beans/:id` | Update bean | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/beans/:id` | Delete bean | |
| GET | `/api/v1/beans/:id/batches` | List batches for a bean | |
| POST | `/api/v1/beans/:id/batches` | Create batch | |
| GET | `/api/v1/bean-batches` | List batches across all beans | |
| GET | `/api/v1/bean-batches/:id` | Get batch | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/bean-batches/:id` | Update batch | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/bean-batches/:id` | Delete batch | |

### Grinders

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/grinders` | List all grinders | `grinders_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/grinders` | Create grinder | |
| GET | `/api/v1/grinders/:id` | Get grinder | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/grinders/:id` | Update grinder | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/grinders/:id` | Delete grinder | |

### Settings

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/settings` | All app settings (gateway, theme, charging, devices, etc.) | `settings_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/settings` | Update settings (partial, key-by-key) | |

Settings fields include: `gatewayMode`, `themeMode`, `logLevel`, `weightFlowMultiplier`, `volumeFlowMultiplier`, `hotWaterFlowMultiplier`, `scalePowerMode`, `blockOnNoScale`, `blockTareDuringShot`, `stopHotWaterAtWeight`, `preferredMachineId`, `preferredScaleId`, `defaultSkinId`, `automaticUpdateCheck`, `chargingMode`, `nightModeEnabled`, `nightModeSleepTime`, `nightModeMorningTime`, `lowBatteryBrightnessLimit`, `keepAwake`, `simulatedDevices`.

`stopHotWaterAtWeight` (boolean, default `true`): when on and a scale is connected, hot-water dispensing tares the scale and stops at the configured hot-water `volume` target treated as grams (mirrors the espresso stop-at-weight). The machine's own volume/time stop remains a backstop, and the value is ignored in `full` gateway mode (a skin owns the machine). `hotWaterFlowMultiplier` (number, default `0.3`) is the seconds-of-lookahead applied to scale weight flow for that stop — separate from `weightFlowMultiplier` because hot water dispenses with a different pump/flow profile than espresso. See [DeviceManagement.md](DeviceManagement.md#hot-water-stop-at-weight).

`blockTareDuringShot` (boolean, default `false`): when on, `PUT /api/v1/scale/tare` is rejected with `400` (`type: "block_tare_during_shot"`) while an **app-tracked** espresso shot is actively brewing (any `ShotState` other than `idle`/`finished`). Prevents a stray programmatic tare (skin, external client) from re-zeroing the scale mid-pour and wrecking stop-at-weight. Does not affect the shot sequencer's own arm-before-pour tare or a manual tare via the scale's physical button — those never go through this endpoint. **`full` gateway mode is an explicit policy exemption**: the skin owns the shot there, so this lockout never blocks a tare in that mode, regardless of any app-tracked (including stale or unexpected) shot state.

### WebUI & Skins

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/webui/skins` | List installed skins | `webui_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/webui/skins/:id` | Get skin details | |
| GET | `/api/v1/webui/skins/default` | Get default skin | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/webui/skins/default` | Set default skin (`{skinId}`) | |
| POST | `/api/v1/webui/skins/install/github-release` | Install from GitHub release | |
| POST | `/api/v1/webui/skins/install/github-branch` | Install from GitHub branch and persist its source for update checks | |
| POST | `/api/v1/webui/skins/install/url` | Install from ZIP URL | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/webui/skins/:id` | Remove installed skin | |
| POST | `/api/v1/webui/skins/update` | Check all skins for updates from remote sources | |
| GET | `/api/v1/webui/server/status` | Server status (`{serving, path, port, ip}`) | |
| POST | `/api/v1/webui/server/start` | Start serving default skin on port 3000 | |
| POST | `/api/v1/webui/server/stop` | Stop serving | |
| GET | `/api/v1/webui/skin-assets/:id/:filepath` | Fetch a file from another installed skin (cross-skin asset sharing) | |

### Plugins

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/plugins` | List all plugins (with `loaded`, `autoLoad`, `source`, `pendingUpdate` fields) | `plugins_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/settings` | Get plugin settings; secure fields return `{isSet}` only | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/settings` | Patch plugin settings (omitted preserves, `null` clears), reload the plugin if loaded, and return a redacted result | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/enable` | Load plugin + enable auto-load | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/disable` | Unload plugin + disable auto-load | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/plugins/:id` | Remove plugin (unload + delete files) | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/source` | Create or overwrite `manifest.json` + `plugin.js` | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/install` | Not supported — returns 501 naming the GitHub endpoints | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/install/github-release` | Install from a GitHub release asset; tag must equal the manifest version | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/install/github-branch` | Install from a GitHub branch; the resolved commit drives updates | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/update` | Check every GitHub-backed plugin for updates | |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/update/approve` | Install an update that asks for new permissions | |
| ANY | `/api/v1/plugins/:id/:endpoint` | Plugin HTTP endpoint; requires `api` and returns 403 without it | |
| WS | `/ws/v1/plugins/:id/:endpoint` | Plugin WebSocket endpoint | |

Plugin setting updates use patch semantics for every field: an omitted field
preserves the existing value, a field sent as `null` clears it, and a secure
field sent as its returned `{ "isSet": true|false }` object preserves the
stored credential. Secure values are never returned by either endpoint,
including the POST response.

### Display

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/display` | Display state (brightness, wakelock) | `display_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/display/brightness` | Set brightness | |
| POST | `/api/v1/display/wakelock` | Request wakelock override | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/display/wakelock` | Release wakelock override | |

### Presence & Sleep

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/machine/heartbeat` | Signal user presence (keep-alive) | `presence_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/presence/settings` | Get presence/sleep settings | |
| POST | `/api/v1/presence/settings` | Update presence/sleep settings (validated — see below) | |
| GET | `/api/v1/presence/schedules` | List wake schedules | |
| POST | `/api/v1/presence/schedules` | Create wake schedule | |
| PUT | `/api/v1/presence/schedules/:id` | Update wake schedule | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/presence/schedules/:id` | Delete wake schedule | |

`POST /api/v1/presence/settings` validates its body before persisting anything:

| Field | Accepted | On anything else |
|---|---|---|
| `userPresenceEnabled` | a boolean | `400`, nothing stored |
| `sleepTimeoutMinutes` | a JSON integer | `400`, nothing stored |

Integer values for `sleepTimeoutMinutes` are normalized into **0..240**. `0` disables the app-side
idle sleep timer. Partial updates are supported — fields are optional. Invalid field types in the
same request prevent all fields from being stored (validation is atomic).

### Sensors

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/sensors` | List connected sensors | `sensors_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/sensors/:id` | Get sensor manifest | |
| POST | `/api/v1/sensors/:id/execute` | Execute sensor command | |

Plugin-backed sensors registered through `host.devices` use this same API and
the device inventory. Their stable IDs have the form
`plugin:<pluginId>:<driverId>:<instanceId>`. Sensor manifests expose command
result schemas as `resultsSchema`. See `Plugins.md` for registration and
lifecycle rules.

#### `Bengle EBus Tap` sensor

The Bengle EBus tap (USB interface `2` of a composite Bengle, VID `0x2e8a` /
PID `0x000a`) is exposed through the generic Sensors surface — no new REST
path. Manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "Bengle EBus Tap",
  "vendor": "Decent Espresso",
  "data": [{"key": "bytes", "type": "string", "unit": "base64"}],
  "commands": [{"id": "write", "paramsSchema": {"bytes": "string"}}]
}
```

`GET /api/v1/sensors` lists the tap under its stable ID
`usb-2e8a-a-<serial>-if02`. Each frame on `/ws/v1/sensors/<id>/snapshot` is one
serial read chunk:

```json
{"timestamp": "2026-08-31T12:34:56.789Z", "bytes": "tp4..."}
```

`bytes` is standard base64; concatenating decoded chunks reproduces the exact
serial byte stream. Chunk boundaries carry no protocol meaning.

Raw write base64-decodes `bytes`, writes exactly those bytes to the tap, and
returns the byte count written:

```text
POST /api/v1/sensors/usb-2e8a-a-<serial>-if02/execute
{"commandId": "write", "params": {"bytes": "AO4A"}}
→ {"status": "ok", "result": {"bytesWritten": 3}}
```

Malformed or missing base64 is rejected before any write. The tap is
single-owner: no other reader may hold the port while Decaid owns it.

### Key-Value Store

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/store/:namespace` | List keys in namespace (or `?full=1` for the whole namespace) | `kv_store_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/store/:namespace/:key` | Get value | |
| POST | `/api/v1/store/:namespace/:key` | Set value | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/store/:namespace/:key` | Delete key | |

`GET /api/v1/store/:namespace?full=1` returns the entire namespace as a `{key: value}` map in one request instead of one GET per key. It sends an `ETag`, so a repeat request with `If-None-Match` returns `304 Not Modified` when nothing changed — cheap to poll. Without the flag the endpoint returns just the array of keys.

### Data Management

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/data/export` | Export full backup as ZIP | `data_export_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/data/import` | Import from ZIP (raw bytes, `Content-Type: application/zip`) | |
| POST | `/api/v1/data/sync` | Sync with another Bridge instance | `data_sync_handler.dart` |

Sync accepts `target` (URL), `mode` (`pull`, `push`, `two_way`), `onConflict` (`skip` or `overwrite`), and `sections` (profiles, shots, workflow, settings, store, steams, beans, grinders). The `target` must be an HTTP/HTTPS origin with no path, query, or fragment; a trailing slash is accepted and equivalent, and IPv4, hostname, and IPv6 hosts are supported. Other forms return `400` before any network request. `sections` is optional for all three modes; omission means all locally registered sections. An explicitly empty or malformed list, or unknown section, returns `400` before any network request. Duplicate names are deduplicated in first-occurrence order.

Sync responses use semantic results rather than transport status alone. Each direct section under `pull.<section>` and `push.<section>` remains available and gains `status` (`complete`, `partial`, or `failed`). Additive phase metadata is under `phases.<phase>` with `status`, `complete`, and `partial`; fatal phase details remain available at the legacy `pull` or `push` path and are repeated under `phases`. Skipped-push reasons are reported under `phases`. A phase is complete only when every expected section is represented without errors. Warnings, conflict skips, and zero imported records do not make a valid section partial. Section errors with progress are partial; errors without progress are failed. Partial imports are not transactional.

In `two_way` mode, push runs only after every expected pull section completes by default. Set `continueOnPullFailure: true` to explicitly continue after a partial or failed pull; the option is limited to `two_way` and is never inferred from overwrite handling. A complete operation returns `200`, an incomplete single-direction operation returns `502`, and an incomplete two-way operation with meaningful progress returns `207`; a two-way operation with no complete or partial phase returns `502` (its body may still report `partial` only when meaningful progress exists). Legacy flat and structured remote import responses are supported, but malformed, contradictory, hybrid, missing-section, and HTTP `200` responses with embedded errors are not treated as success.

Backups are ZIP archives with one JSON file per registered section:
`profiles.json`, `shots.json`, `workflow.json`, `settings.json`, `store.json`,
`steams.json`, `beans.json`, and `grinders.json`. Import matches files by their
registered section names; unknown files are ignored, but an archive must contain
at least one recognized selected section. `metadata.json` is not payload:
metadata-only, empty, and unknown-only archives return `400`. Metadata is
optional for legacy archives without it. When present, its JSON and
`formatVersion` are validated before any section is imported. ZIP integrity and
structural JSON are validated for every selected section before storage is
mutated; any failure returns `400` without importing a section. Semantic record
errors are processed independently and are not transactional, so successful
sections are not rolled back when another section reports semantic errors.
Export is atomic: if any requested
section fails to export, the request returns an error identifying the failed
section(s) and no partial ZIP is returned.

`POST /api/v1/data/import` preserves its section-keyed response body. `200`
means at least one recognized section was processed and every processed section
completed without errors. `207 Multi-Status` means at least one processed
section contains errors; successful sections, counts, warnings, and errors are
all retained. Warnings and conflict-strategy skips alone still return `200`.
Clients must inspect both the HTTP status and each section result.

Data sync preserves the same phase distinction. A complete pull or push is
represented by `200`. An incomplete single-direction sync returns `502`, even
when its body reports semantic `partial` progress. A two-way sync returns `207`
when it has meaningful progress but is incomplete; a two-way sync with no
complete or partial phase returns `502`. Phase results remain under `pull` and
`push`, including successful sections and fatal error details.

### Bounded-memory transfer (issue #555)

Backup export, import, and sync stream data instead of buffering whole
archives in memory; peak memory scales with one page of records and one JSON
record, never with backup size.

- **Export** streams each section (records paged via stable keyset cursors)
  through a file-backed ZIP writer (raw deflate via `dart:io`, data
descriptors, central directory written last) and serves the completed
temporary ZIP with `Content-Type: application/zip`, `Content-Disposition:
attachment`, and `Content-Length`. The archive is atomic: a failing section
returns an error and no partial ZIP.
- **Import** streams the request body into a temporary ZIP (never
`read().toList()`), opens it with `InputFileStream` / `ZipDecoder`, and writes
one selected entry at a time to a bounded temporary JSON file for incremental
parsing. Every selected entry is structurally validated before the record-import
pass begins. ZIP bombs, duplicate names, encrypted/unsupported entries, CRC
failures, truncation, Zip64, and malformed JSON all fail safely. A 30-second
idle request body is cancelled with `408`.
- **Sync** pulls stream the remote response into a temporary ZIP; pushes
export locally and stream the file with a known content length.
- **Native transfer** downloads the localhost export into a temporary file
(validating HTTP status and `application/zip` before presenting a
destination), shares it via the OS share sheet on iOS/Android, and streams
picked files into the import request.

Limits (documented in `assets/api/rest_v1.yml`): request body 2 GiB, entry
count 4096, per-entry uncompressed 1 GiB, total uncompressed 2 GiB,
metadata 64 KiB, per-record 64 MiB (measured in UTF-8 bytes), ZIP header
fields 256 B/64 KiB/64 KiB; sync request body 1 MiB with a 30-second read
deadline, target response 8 MiB; connection 10 s (TCP establishment only — server-side
export/import processing is not counted against it), idle 30 s, and one
deadline (10 min) per phase covering the network stages (upload/download
and response). Timeouts abort the request at the transport level: a
timed-out pull is cut off even while the target is still generating its
export (before headers) and never starts its import; a timed-out push
aborts its upload, and the upload is backpressured so the archive file
is never read ahead of the network. Local export and the pull-side
import run to completion and report their actual results. If the archive
was already fully uploaded before the deadline, the remote outcome is
unknown and the phase reports reason `timeout_unknown`. A generated
archive is also bounded by the 2 GiB import request limit.

### Account

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/account/decent` | Decent account auth status: `{loggedIn}` (true only when stored credentials are accepted by the backend) | `account_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/account/proxy/<path>` | Auth-enriching proxy to `decentespresso.com/<path>` | `account_proxy_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/account/proxy/<path>` | Auth-enriching write proxy (relays body) | `account_proxy_handler.dart` |
| PUT | `/api/v1/account/proxy/<path>` | Auth-enriching write proxy (relays body) | `account_proxy_handler.dart` |

Linking/unlinking a Decent account is **native-only** — there are no network login/logout routes. The webserver is unauthenticated with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so exposing credential operations would let any LAN client or browser origin store attacker credentials or unlink the account. The status response omits the linked email (PII).

The **proxy** lets clients *use* the account without ever seeing the credentials: it attaches the linked account's Basic auth server-side, forwards to `decentespresso.com`, and relays the upstream status + body verbatim. It requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and is enforced only on this path. `GET` requires `account:proxy` (including the skin token injected into served skin pages); `POST`/`PUT` require the stronger `account:proxy:write` scope, so the read-only skin token cannot write. Forwarding is restricted to the `support/api/` prefix. The OpenAPI spec documents the generated-client-safe `/support/api/{endpoint}` form; use this raw catch-all route when a Decent backend path contains additional slashes. Each served skin generation gets a fresh origin and token bound to that skin's immutable consent key; switching or stopping the skin server revokes the previous token. The stable port 3000 entry point redirects without caching to the active origin. The first request from each skin, plugin, or named API client pauses for native approval on the Decaid device. Explicit allow and deny decisions are remembered; a 30-second timeout denies only that request. Responses: 401 (missing/invalid token or no linked account), 403 (token unscoped, path not allowed, or account access not granted). Write-scoped tokens are minted from the account page's API-token UI by enabling "Allow write access". Headless operators can grant session-only access with `--trust-consent=<caller-key>` or `--trust-all-consent`.

### Other

| Method | Path | Description | Handler |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/info` | Build metadata (version, commit, branch) + gateway LAN IP (`localIp`) | `info_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/diagnostics/ble` | Read-only BLE adapter, scan/watch ownership, reconnect policy, cache, and advertisement diagnostics | `ble_diagnostics_handler.dart` |

| POST | `/api/v1/feedback` | Submit feedback (creates GitHub issue) | `feedback_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/logs` | Recent log entries, newest first. Live log + rotated files `log.txt.1..N` are always stitched chronologically; response is a size-bounded tail window (`?kb=N`, default 1024 KB, clamped to 4096 KB). `?order=asc` for original chronological order | `logs_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/webview/logs` | WebView console log forwarding, newest first (`?order=asc` for original chronological order) | `webview_logs_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/derek/answers/stream` | Relay to the Derek RAG assistant: forwards the JSON body verbatim to `derek.decentespresso.com/api/answers/stream` and pipes the SSE response back unbuffered. No auth (public data). Exists so browser skins avoid Derek's failing CORS preflight. | `derek_handler.dart` |

### Debug (debug builds only)

Only registered when the app is launched with a non-empty `simulate` Dart define. Use `--dart-define=simulate=0` to enable the routes without selecting simulated devices. Returns 404 on production builds.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Handler |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/debug/update/force` | Force a fake "update available" so the update API/UI can be tested without a real newer release. Optional query: `version` (default `99.0.0`), `downloadUrl` (default = real latest APK, so the download/install path runs end-to-end). | `debug_handler.dart` |
| GET | `/api/v1/debug/flow-smoothing` | Read process-local display-flow smoothing (`windowMs`, `movingAverageSamples`). | `debug_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/debug/flow-smoothing` | Atomically update and reset display-flow smoothing; accepts integer `windowMs` (100–2000) and `movingAverageSamples` (1–50). | `debug_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/debug/scale/stall` | Pause mock scale weight emission (stays "connected") | `debug_handler.dart` |

| GET | `/api/v1/debug/replay/shots` | List the replay simulator's bundled recordings (stable `id` + `profileTitle`) and the current forced selection (`simulate=replay`). | `debug_handler.dart` |
| POST | `/api/v1/debug/replay/shot/{id}` | Force ReplayDE1 to play recording `id` on subsequent pulls (session-only); overrides profile-match/fallback. | `debug_handler.dart` |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/debug/replay/shot` | Clear the forced recording, returning to profile-match/fallback selection. | `debug_handler.dart` |

Mock-scale command endpoints return 400 if no scale is connected or the connected scale is not a `MockScale`. The machine command endpoint returns 400 if no machine is connected or the connected machine is not a `MockDe1`, and 404 for unknown commands (any debug route 404s on production builds).

## WebSocket API

All WebSocket endpoints are on port 8080 at `/ws/v1/...`. See [`assets/api/websocket_v1.yml`](../assets/api/websocket_v1.yml) for full schemas.

| Path | Description | Data |
|------|-------------|------|
| `/ws/v1/machine/snapshot` | Machine state stream (~10Hz). Re-binds across a machine reconnect — see [Machine sockets re-bind](#machine-sockets-re-bind-across-a-reconnect). | Temps, pressures, flow, state |
| `/ws/v1/scale/snapshot` | Scale weight/flow stream. Device-provided flow is passed through; weight-only scales use Decaid's estimator. Stays open across scale disconnects; emits `{"status":"connected"\|"disconnected"}` frames on state change. | Weight, flow, battery |
| `/ws/v1/machine/shotSettings` | Shot settings changes. Re-binds across a machine reconnect. | Target temp, volume, weight |
| `/ws/v1/machine/waterLevels` | Water level changes. Re-binds across a machine reconnect. | Current/limit levels |
| `/ws/v1/machine/raw` | Raw BLE characteristic data. Re-binds across a machine reconnect; writes go to the currently-bound machine. | Hex-encoded bytes |
| `/ws/v1/machine/shotState` | Shot sequencer state + decision feed: why a step advanced, why the shot stopped. Replays the latest frame on connect; idle between shots; not gated on a connected machine. | `event` (`state`\|`decision`\|`terminal`), `shotId`, shot phase, machine context, `decision {kind, reason, details, data}` |
| `/ws/v1/devices` | Device discovery + `ConnectionManager` status (phase, found devices, ambiguity, errors). Also accepts `scan`/`connect`/`disconnect` commands. | Device list, `connectionStatus` |
| `/ws/v1/sensors/:id/snapshot` | Sensor data stream. Re-binds across replacement or transient removal/re-add of the same sensor ID. | Sensor-specific |
| `/ws/v1/plugins/:id/:endpoint` | Plugin WebSocket proxy | Plugin-specific |
| `/ws/v1/logs` | App log stream | Timestamped log entries |
| `/ws/v1/webview/logs` | WebView console log stream | WebView console messages |
| `/ws/v1/display` | Display state changes | Brightness, wakelock |
| `/ws/v1/update` | App-update state stream. Also accepts `{"command":"check"}` (refused on macOS and on externally managed App Store/TestFlight builds, where the store owns app updates) and `{"command":"install"}` (Android installs; refused elsewhere). Either refusal replies `{"error","url"}` carrying `releaseUrl` — the release tag when one is known, otherwise the releases page. | `phase`, `progress`, `latestVersion`, `installable` |

### Machine sockets re-bind across a reconnect

When a machine reconnects — a power-cycle, a USB re-enumeration, a BLE drop — the app discards the
old machine object and builds a new one. The machine sockets
(`/ws/v1/machine/{snapshot,shotSettings,waterLevels,raw}`) **follow the swap**: the server re-attaches
each open socket to the new machine and frames resume on their own.

For clients this means:

- **Clients do not need to reconnect solely because the machine disconnects.** The socket stays open
  and goes quiet while no machine is connected, then resumes. This mirrors `/ws/v1/scale/snapshot`.
  The existing socket follows a normal machine instance swap, but clients should still reconnect after
  actual WebSocket closure, network failure, or according to their normal liveness policy.
  `/ws/v1/devices` is the authoritative source for machine connection state.
- **No status frame is emitted.** Unlike the scale socket, each machine socket carries exactly one
  payload type per frame, and existing clients parse every frame as that type — a `{"status": ...}`
  frame would break the wire contract. Track link state on `/ws/v1/devices` instead, which reports it
  independently of any machine instance.
- **A gap in frames is not a dead socket.** If a client needs a liveness signal, use `/ws/v1/devices`.
- `/ws/v1/machine/raw` writes are delivered to the machine the socket is *currently* bound to, not the
  one that was present when the socket was opened.
- If a raw command is sent while no machine is connected, the server replies with
  `{"error": "No machine connected"}` rather than silently dropping it. The socket stays open and
  resumes normal operation when a machine reconnects. Raw commands are not queued for later delivery.

Machine sockets opened before the first machine connection behave like any later disconnected gap:
the socket stays open and remains silent until a machine attaches. No error or status frame is emitted
on the typed telemetry sockets.

### Sensor sockets follow replacement

An open `/ws/v1/sensors/:id/snapshot` socket follows the current sensor instance for its ID. When that
sensor is replaced, the server cancels the old data subscription and binds the socket to the replacement.
During a transient removal the socket stays open and silent, then resumes when the same ID returns. The
channel remains sensor-data-only and emits no connection status frames.

The initial lookup is unchanged: opening a socket for an ID that is not present returns
`{"error":"not found"}` and closes the socket.

### `shotState` events

`/ws/v1/machine/shotState` streams the app's shot-sequencer decisions as a single event type
discriminated by `event`. Every frame carries the current shot phase (`state`) and machine context,
so a late joiner gets a coherent view from any single frame; `decision` is non-null only on
`decision`/`terminal` frames.

```json
{
  "event": "decision",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-17T10:32:18.903Z",
  "shotId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "state": "pouring",
  "machineState": "espresso",
  "machineSubstate": "pouring",
  "profileFrame": 2,
  "scaleConnected": true,
  "scaleLost": false,
  "machineHasAutonomousSAW": false,
  "decision": {
    "kind": "stop",
    "reason": "targetWeight",
    "details": "Target weight 36.0g reached (projected: 36.4). Stopping shot.",
    "data": {"targetYield": 36.0, "projectedWeight": 36.4}
  }
}
```

- `shotId` equals the persisted `ShotRecord.id`, so the stream can be correlated to the saved shot.
  The final stop reason is also persisted on the record as `stopReason`.
- `decision.reason` is an **open set** — tolerate unknown values. Known reasons: `targetWeight`,
  `targetVolume` (app-side targets), `profileSkip` (app-issued weight skip), `profileAdvance`
  (firmware-natural step exit), `apiStop` / `appStop` (stop command attributed to a REST client /
  the in-app Stop button), `machineEnded` (GHC stop or natural profile completion —
  indistinguishable), `noScale` (blocked by `blockOnNoScale`), `error` / `disconnected` (abnormal
  endings, `event: "terminal"`), `stoppingBackstop` (post-stop settling window closed by the safety
  timer; never the stop reason itself).
- Coverage: the feed reflects app-side sequencing only. In full gateway mode with the app
  backgrounded no sequencer runs (the feed stays `idle`), and on machines with autonomous
  stop-at-weight (Bengle) the final yield stop is firmware-side and reported as `machineEnded`.

### `connectionStatus.error`

When a BLE operation fails (connect timeout, mid-session disconnect, adapter off, permission denied, scan failure, or profile upload failure), the devices WebSocket emits an update with a structured `connectionStatus.error` object. `null` when no error is active.

```json
{
  "kind": "scaleConnectFailed",
  "severity": "error",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-19T07:49:29.025Z",
  "deviceId": "50:78:7D:1F:AE:E1",
  "deviceName": "Decent Scale",
  "message": "Scale Decent Scale failed to connect.",
  "suggestion": "Wake the scale and try again.",
  "details": {"fbp_code": 1}
}
```

See [`assets/api/websocket_v1.yml`](../assets/api/websocket_v1.yml) for the full `ConnectionError` schema. Full `kind` taxonomy, lifecycle rules, and the recommended skin handling pattern are in [`doc/Skins.md`](Skins.md#handling-connection-errors).

## Bundled Plugins

### Auto Steam Calculator (`calibrated-steam.reaplugin`)

Bundled but disabled by default. Once enabled, its `GET status`, `GET ui`,
`POST validate`, `POST calculate` and `POST calibration` endpoints are available below
`/api/v1/plugins/calibrated-steam.reaplugin/`. It estimates a duration using saved
milk-weight/time calibration and Damian's DSx2 pitcher-selection heuristic. Calculation
does not control the machine: a skin revalidates the result and applies
duration and calibration flow through `PUT /api/v1/workflow`. The skin restores
its existing normal heater setting after its temporary Off state. See
[Auto Steam Calculator](CalibratedSteam.md) for configuration, request/response
examples and the skin developer contract. No DYE2 dependency is required.

Auto Steam Calculator uses calculator API 4 (duration and flow only).
Requests select `pitcher`; responses include `pitcher`, `pitcherSource` and
`pitcherGrams`. Pitcher settings use `smallPitcherGrams`, `mediumPitcherGrams`,
`largePitcherGrams`, `singleDrinkPitcher` and `defaultPitcher`.
Single-flow `referenceMilkGrams` and each flow reading's `milkGrams` store actual
measured milk weight. `targetTemperatureC` is an optional milk-temperature note;
0 means unset. The note does not change calculated duration or machine settings.
Status includes `availablePitchers`, `calibrationActive`, and optional
`flowCalibration` (mode, adjustable bounds, default and parsed readings; null if
invalid). `calculate` accepts optional `flow`, defaulting to `referenceFlow`.
Multiple-flow calibration interpolates seconds per gram between adjacent readings
and rejects flows outside measured bounds with `flow_out_of_range`. Single flow is the default calibration mode. Readings persist as a JSON string in `flowReadings`. Guided calibration
uses a token-owned session to prepare flow/heater/timer, follow actual pouring
time and restore the prior steam settings. Its actions are begin, heartbeat, start,
stop and cancel; see the calculator guide for the lease and result contract. Skins render only
those choices and require `ready` before calculating. The standalone `ui` accepts
`returnTo` for returning to the calling skin's settings after save or cancellation.
Its compact tabs share one flow setting. Milk-range errors now identify the
selected or inferred pitcher in a short message; error codes remain unchanged.
See [CalibratedSteam.md](CalibratedSteam.md) for setup rules and compatibility keys.

### Settings Plugin (`settings.reaplugin`)

Built-in settings dashboard accessible at `/api/v1/plugins/settings.reaplugin/ui`. Provides a web-based interface for managing all app settings, skins, plugins, data, and more.

**Query parameters:**
- `backName` — customizes the back button label. E.g., `/api/v1/plugins/settings.reaplugin/ui?backName=Extracto` shows "Back to Extracto" instead of "Back to WebUI".

**Sections:** REA Application Settings, Battery & Charging, Machine Settings, Machine Advanced Settings, Calibration, Presence & Sleep, Simulated Devices, Web Interface (skin management + server control), Data Management (export/import/sync), Plugin Management, Feedback, About.

**Self-protection:** The plugin management section prevents disabling or removing `settings.reaplugin` itself (UI guard).

### DYE2 Plugin (`dye2.reaplugin`)

Bean and grinder management. See [`packages/dye2-plugin/README.md`](../packages/dye2-plugin/README.md).

### Scale information

`GET /api/v1/scale/info` returns optional metadata for the currently connected scale, such as opaque `firmwareVersion`. It returns `503` when no scale is connected. Device inventory remains separate: `/api/v1/devices` and `/ws/v1/devices` describe discovery and connection state only and never include connection-scoped scale metadata.
